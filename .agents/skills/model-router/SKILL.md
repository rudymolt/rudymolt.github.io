description: Discover verified model routes and launch the selected Plan, Build, or Verify lane. Use at feature-lane boundaries, when the user types models or openai defaults, or when a saved model route must resume.

# /model-router

Route one feature lane without turning model choice into a separate ceremony. The chat prompt is the canonical interface; buttons are optional enhancements.

Read [`references/chat-prompts.md`](references/chat-prompts.md) before rendering a chooser or recovery prompt. Read [`references/host-adapters.md`](references/host-adapters.md) only for the detected host or runner.

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Identify the lane and feature

Map stages 01–06 to **Plan**, stage 07 and fix cycles to **Build**, and stages 08–09 to **Verify**. Use the human feature title. Read any persisted route for this lane and the feature-scoped prompt policy. Read the active run pace separately: standard by default, or fast when the human appended `fast`/said they are waiting for this run.

Completion criterion: one lane, one human title, and any prior selection or retry policy are known.

### Step 2 — Discover verified routes

Enumerate the current host catalog, provider catalog, CLI listing, or previously validated route. Normalize each result to model ID, label, provider, runner, reasoning, launch mode, permission strength, handoff delivery, and fast-mode capability. Detect the current chat route when metadata is available.

Exclude unauthenticated, administrator-blocked, unavailable, and identity-unverifiable routes. Never invent cost, quality, or availability claims.

Completion criterion: every displayed route is live and has one exact launch consequence: current tab, named sidecar, or named Conductor new-tab handoff.

### Step 3 — Render the stage prompt

Use the lane prompt in `references/chat-prompts.md`. Show the OpenAI lane default in the normal prompt. Put alternatives behind `models`, with at most three verified routes plus `more`. Use numbered choices starting at 1.

At Plan, accept `openai defaults` to record Sol/high → Terra/high → Sol/medium for this feature. It starts Plan, but later Build and Verify action gates remain explicit. At Build, accept `fast` as a suffix on the build scope (for example `build all fast`); it changes pace for this Build → returned-fix → fresh-Verify run only, not model, reasoning, tests, permissions, or gates. When the current chat route differs in any user-relevant identity field, use the conflict prompt and persist it only after `plan here`, `current`, or `verify here`.

Completion criterion: the prompt works in a text-only chat, uses no more than four options, and says what starts now, what starts nothing, and how the selected route launches.

### Step 4 — Persist the selection before launch

For pre-feature Plan, create or reuse one `pending_model_routes[]` entry. Do not create a feature folder or increment feature counters. For a feature lane, write the selection under `active_features[].routing.lanes`.

Record identity as pending, then requested and runtime-reported model IDs, evidence kind, verification time, and the pace actually used. `models`, `more`, `back`, and `not now` write nothing. Retries reuse the same route, lane entry, and run pace. Pace remains historical evidence after handoff; it never becomes the next run's default.

Completion criterion: the requested route is durable and idempotent without changing unrelated state or counters.

### Step 5 — Launch and verify identity

Use argument arrays or standard input for provider CLIs. Start fresh context for Verify and whenever the route contract requires it. Apply enforced read-only for Plan or Verify only when the runner actually provides it; otherwise use the permission-recovery prompt. Apply fast pace only when the Codex/host route reports `fast_mode` available; otherwise offer standard pace or `not now` instead of imitating speed with another model or reasoning level.

Deliver sidecar handoffs automatically. For a manual Conductor route, write the documented handoff path and give the exact resume command. Require the authoritative worker-result envelope from `93-model-routing-track.md`: model ID, reasoning effort, thinking state (from the enforced runtime configuration, guarding tool-call-leaked-into-text corruption), correlated thread ID, runner, permission mode, tool calls used/remaining, and wall time used/remaining. Accept output only after authoritative runtime evidence matches the requested model, effort, thinking state, runner, thread correlation, and permission boundary; prefer session/thread metadata, provider response metadata, or host-reported selection. Reject any route mismatch automatically. Model-generated self-description is not authoritative identity evidence. When a required identity or permission field has no authoritative surface, stop as identity-unverifiable; host-unavailable usage counters are marked `unavailable` and the declared external ceiling remains authoritative.

Completion criterion: the selected runner starts with the declared permissions and handoff, exposes a complete authoritative envelope whose route fields match the selection, or stops with a truthful recovery prompt.

### Step 6 — Return a compact handoff

Return artifacts, decisions, evidence, blockers, the authoritative runtime envelope, active run pace, and next action. Do not return hidden reasoning transcripts. Planner output contains questions/spec/ADRs/slices; implementer input contains approved artifacts; verifier input contains goal, criteria, diff, tests, commands, docs, and inherited pace without the builder chat. Clear the active pace when the run hands control back to the human.

Update `last_updated`, recompute `status:`, and keep `planning/STATUS.md` pointers aligned whenever routing state changes.

Completion criterion: the coordinator receives a compact artifact handoff plus validated runtime envelope, and project routing state agrees with the active or pending route.

## Guardrails

- Keep Plan, Build, and Verify sequential.
- Never substitute an unavailable model silently.
- Change models only before a run starts; stop and restart with fresh context instead of hot-swapping.
- Retain the Build model through fix cycles unless the human changes it.
- Retain the selected pace through returned fixes and fresh Verify, then clear it at handback.
- Treat Conductor as the workspace coordinator, never as the model provider or permission boundary.
- Preserve the working tree and return a structured blocker when Build cannot continue.
